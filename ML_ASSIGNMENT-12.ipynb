    "       Naïve Bayes classifier is commonly used for text classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis, document categorization, or spam detection. In this context, the classifier learns from a labeled training dataset consisting of text documents and their corresponding class labels. It assumes that the features (words or word frequencies) in the document are conditionally independent given the class label. The Naïve Bayes classifier calculates the posterior probability of each class given the document's features and assigns the class label with the highest probability. For example, in sentiment analysis, the classifier can determine whether a given text expresses a positive or negative sentiment based on the words used.\n",

It analyzes the features of the emails, such as the presence of certain words or patterns, and calculates the posterior probability of each class (spam or ham) given the features. The classifier then assigns a label to incoming emails based on the class with the highest probability. Naïve Bayes is particularly effective for spam filtering due to its ability to handle high-dimensional feature spaces and its simplicity in handling large amounts of data.\n",

It analyzes the features in the text, such as words, phrases, or sentiment indicators, and calculates the posterior probability of each sentiment class given the features. By assigning sentiment labels to incoming market-related texts, the classifier can assist in understanding market trends, making investment decisions, or assessing market sentiment in real-time.\n",
